    <p>Upon completing a Transaction, you are entering into a legally binding and enforceable agreement with us
    to purchase the product and/or service. After this point the User may cancel the Transaction unless it has
    been specifically provided for on the Platform. In which case, the cancellation will be subject to the terms
    mentioned on the Platform. We shall retain the discretion in approving any cancellation requests and we may
    ask for additional details before approving any requests.</p>

    <p>Once you have received the product and/or service, the only event where you can request for a replacement
    or a return and a refund is if the product and/or service does not match the description as mentioned on the
    Platform.</p>

    <p>Any request for refund must be submitted within three days from the date of the Transaction or such
    number of days prescribed on the Platform, which shall in no event be less than three days.</p>

    <p>A User may submit a claim for a refund for a purchase made, by raising a ticket
    <a href="mailto:<?= e(setting('contact_email')) ?>">here</a> or contacting us on
    <a href="mailto:<?= e(setting('contact_email')) ?>"><?= e(setting('contact_email')) ?></a> and providing a
    clear and specific reason for the refund request, including the exact terms that have been violated, along
    with any proof, if required. Whether a refund will be provided will be determined by us, and we may ask for
    additional details before approving any requests.</p>
